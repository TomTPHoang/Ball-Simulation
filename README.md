Bouncing Ball Simulation using raylib
This project simulates a bouncing ball inside a window using the raylib library. The ball moves smoothly and consistently, independent of the system's frame rate, while allowing the user to control the frame rate, restart the simulation, and view debugging information.

Features
Frame Rate Independence: The ballâ€™s movement is frame rate independent, relying on elapsed time.

Frame Rate Control: Capable of capping frame rate to 60 FPS, 120 FPS, or uncapped.

Breakpoint Handling: Gracefully handles large delta times.

Debug Overlay: Displays current FPS, elapsed time, and delta time.

Keybinds:

1: Set FPS to 60

2: Set FPS to 120

3: Uncapped FPS

R: Restart the simulation

ESC: Exit the program
